# StrictlyZero Proficiency

FizzBuzz is a classic programming exercise that is often used as a quick way to test a developer's skills. It involves printing out the numbers from 1 to n, where n is a given number. However, if a number is divisible by 3, you should print "Fizz" instead of the number, and if a number is divisible by 5, you should print "Buzz" instead of the number. If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you should print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

For example, if n is 10, the output should be:

```sh
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
```

To solve the FizzBuzz exercise, you will need to write a program that can take in a number n and generate the correct output. This program should be written in a language of your choice, but it should be a language that is commonly used for solving programming challenges.
The program should also include some basic instructions for how to run it, as well as a brief description of how it works.
For example, if you were writing the program in Python, the top of your program might look something like this:

```sh
# FizzBuzz

This program solves the FizzBuzz exercise by taking in a number n and generating the correct output.

To run this program, open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where the program is saved. Then, run the following command:

node fizzbuzz.js
```

After this brief introduction, you can then include the code for your program. Be sure to include comments throughout your code to explain what each part of the program is doing.
Once you have completed your program, you can use it to solve the FizzBuzz exercise and test your skills as a developer.
